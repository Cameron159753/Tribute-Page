        Wanting to become a docter, Desmond Tutu secured admission to study medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand, however his parents could not afford the tuition fees.
        Instead, he turned toward teaching, gaining a government scholarship to start a course at Pretoria in 1951.
        He helped to organise the Literacy and Dramatic Society, and chaired the Cultural and Debating Society for two years.
